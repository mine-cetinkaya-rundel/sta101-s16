\pause

In order to calculate $P(\bar{X} > 1.4~mil)$, we need to first determine the distribution of $\bar{X}$. According to the CLT,

\pause

\[ \bar{X} \pause \sim N \pause \left( mean = 1.3, \pause SE = \frac{0.3}{\sqrt{60}} = 0.0387 \right) \]

\pause

\begin{eqnarray*}
P(\bar{X} > 1.4 ) &=& P\left(Z > \frac{1.4 - 1.3}{0.0387}\right) \\
\pause
&=& P(Z > 2.58) \\
\pause
&=& 1 - 0.9951 \pause =  0.0049

{\small CPR is a procedure commonly used on individuals suffering a heart attack when other emergency resources are not available. The chest compressions involved with this procedure can also cause internal injuries. Blood thinners that are often given to help release a clot that is causing the heart attack may also negatively affect such internal injuries. An experiment was designed to evaluate if blood thinners have an impact on survival after a heart attack. Patients were randomly divided into a treatment group (received a blood thinner) or the control group (no blood thinner). The outcome variable of interest was whether the patients survived for at least 24 hours.}

In order to calculate $P(\bar{X} > 1.4~mil)$, we need to first determine the distribution of $\bar{X}$. According to the CLT,

\pause

\[ \bar{X} \pause \sim N \pause \left( mean = 1.3, \pause SE = \frac{0.3}{\sqrt{60}} = 0.0387 \right) \]

\pause

\begin{eqnarray*}
P(\bar{X} > 1.4 ) &=& P\left(Z > \frac{1.4 - 1.3}{0.0387}\right) \\
\pause
&=& P(Z > 2.58) \\
\pause
&=& 1 - 0.9951 \pause =  0.0049
