the group and to address any potential issues early on.
\begin{itemize}

\begin{itemize}

\item I will regularly send announcements by email, so make sure to check your email  
daily.

\item All content related (non-personal) questions should be posted on Piazza.

\item Before posting a new question please make sure to check if your question has 
already been answered, and answer others' questions.

\item Use informative titles for your posts.

\item It is more efficient to answer most statistical questions ``in person" so make 
use of OH.

\section{Academic Dishonesty}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Academic Dishonesty}

Any form of academic dishonesty will result in an immediate 0 on the given assignment 
and will be reported to the Office of Student Conduct. Additional penalties may also 
be assessed if deemed appropriate. If you have any questions about whether something 
is or is not allowed, ask me beforehand.

Some examples:

\begin{itemize}

\item Use of disallowed materials (including any form of communication with classmates 
or accessing the web) during exams and readiness assessments

\item Plagiarism of any kind

\item Use of outside answer keys or solution manuals for the homework

\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Tips for success}

{\footnotesize
\begin{itemize}[<alert@+>]
\item Complete the reading before a new unit begins, and then review again after the 
unit is over.
\item Be an active participant during lectures and labs.
\item Ask questions - during class or office hours, or by email. Ask me, your TAs, and 
your classmates.
\item Do the problem sets - start early and make sure you attempt and understand all 
questions.
\item Take each PA and complete practice quizzes (on Coursera) for each unit, and
review the feedback for questions you miss.
\item Start your project early and and allow adequate time to complete them.
\item Give yourself plenty of time time to prepare a good cheat sheet for exams. This 
requires going through the material and taking the time to review the concepts that 
you're not comfortable with.
\item Do not procrastinate - don't let a unit go by with unanswered questions as it 
will just make the following unit's material even more difficult to follow.
