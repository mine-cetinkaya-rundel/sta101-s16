\frametitle{Dependence, or another possible explanation?}

\begin{itemize}

\item The observed differences might suggest that yawning is contagious, i.e. seeing someone yawn and yawning are dependent

\pause

\item But the differences are small enough that we might wonder if they might simple be \hl{due to chance}

\pause

\item Perhaps if we were to repeat the experiment, we would see slightly different results

\pause

\item So we will do just that - well, somewhat - and see what happens

\item Instead of actually conducting the experiment many times, we will \hl{simulate} our results

4 queens, and 4 kings.

\item Take out two aces from the deck of cards and set them aside.

\item The remaining 50 playing cards to represent each participant in the study:
\begin{itemize}
\item 14 face cards (including the 2 aces) represent the people who yawn.
\item 36 non-face cards represent the people who don't yawn.

\activity{Running the simulation}{

\item Divide the cards into two decks:
\begin{itemize}
\item deck 1: 16 cards $\rightarrow$ control
\item deck 2: 34 cards $\rightarrow$ treatment
\end{itemize}
\item Count the number of face cards (yawners) in each deck
\item Calculate the difference in proportions of yawners \red{(treatment - control)}, and submit this value 
using your clicker (value must be between 0 and 1) - \textbf{only one submission per team per simulation}
\item Repeat steps (1) - (4) many times

\frametitle{Tapping on caffeine}

\begin{itemize}

\item In a double-blind experiment a sample of male college students were asked to tap their fingers at a rapid rate. 

\item The sample was then divided at random into two groups of 10 students each. 

\item Each student drank the equivalent of about two cups of coffee, which included about 200 mg of caffeine for the students in one group but was decaffeinated coffee for the second group. 

\item After a two hour period, each student was tested to measure finger tapping rate (taps per minute).
