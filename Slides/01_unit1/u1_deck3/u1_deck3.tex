\frametitle{Race and death-penalty sentences in Florida murder cases}

A 1991 study by Radelet and Pierce on race and death-penalty (DP) sentences gives the following table:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{l c c c c}
\hline
Defendant's race    & DP    & No DP     & Total     & \% DP \\
\hline
Caucasian       & 53        & 430   & 483   & \only<2-|handout:0>{\red{11\%}} \\
African American    & 15        & 176   & 191   & \only<3-|handout:0>{\orange{7.9\%}}  \\ 
\hline
Total               & 68        & 606   & 674

\frametitle{Contradiction?}

\begin{itemize}

\item People of one race are more likely to murder others of the same race, murdering a Caucasian is more likely to result in the death penalty, and there are more Caucasian defendants than African American defendants in the sample.

\pause

\item Controlling for the victim's race reveals more insights into the data, and changes the direction of the relationship between race and death penalty.

\pause

\item This phenomenon is called \hl{Simpson's Paradox}: An association, or a comparison, that holds when we compare two groups can disappear or even be reversed when the original groups are broken down into smaller groups according to some other feature (a confounding/lurking variable).
