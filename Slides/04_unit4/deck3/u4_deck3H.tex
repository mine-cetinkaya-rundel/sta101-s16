\section{Main ideas}

%LO 15. Calculate the power of a test for a given effect size and significance level in two steps: 
%(1) Find the cutoff for the sample statistic that will allow the null hypothesis to be rejected at 
%the given significance level, (2) Calculate the probability of obtaining that sample statistic given 
%the effect size.
%
%LO 16. Explain how power changes for changes in effect size, sample size, significance level, 
%and standard error.

\subsection{Not every statistically significant result is practically significant}
\label{mi1}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Reminder: Not every statistically significant result is practically significant}

\begin{itemize}

\item Real differences between the point estimate and null value are easier to detect with larger samples

\item However, very large samples will result in statistical significance even for tiny differences between the 
sample mean and the null value (\hl{effect size}), even when the difference is not practically significant

\item This is especially important to research: if we conduct a study, we want to focus on finding meaningful 
results (we want observed differences to be real but also large enough to matter).

\item The role of a statistician is not just in the analysis of data but also in planning and design of a study.

\end{itemize}

to perform a post-mortem examination: he may be able to say what the experiment died of.''} -- R.A. Fisher}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Reminder: Hypothesis tests have error rates associated with them}

There are two competing hypotheses: the null and the alternative. In a hypothesis test, we make a decision about which might be true, but our choice might be incorrect. \\

\subsection{Type 1 error rate = significance level}
\label{mi3}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Reminder: Type 1 error rate = significance level}

\begin{itemize}

\item As a general rule we reject $H_0$ when the p-value is less than 0.05, i.e. we use a \hl{significance level} of 0.05, \mathhl{\alpha = 0.05}.

\pause

\item This means that, for those cases where $H_0$ is actually true, we will incorrectly reject it at most 5\% of the time.

\pause

\item In other words, when using a 5\% significance level there is about 5\% chance of making a Type 1 error.
\[ \mathhl{ P(\text{Type 1 error}) = P(\text{Reject }H_0 | H_0 \text{ is true}) = \alpha } \]

\pause

\item This is why we prefer small values of $\alpha$ -- increasing $\alpha$ increases the Type 1 error rate.

\end{itemize}

\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\pause

\begin{itemize}
\item Type 1 error is rejecting $H_0$ when you shouldn't have, and the probability of doing so is $\alpha$ (significance level)

\pause

\item Type 2 error is failing to reject $H_0$ when you should have, and the probability of doing so is $\beta$ (a little more complicated to calculate)

\pause

\item \hl{Power} of a test is the probability of correctly rejecting $H_0$, and the probability of doing so is $1 - \beta$

\pause

\item In hypothesis testing, we want to keep $\alpha$ and $\beta$ low, but there are inherent trade-offs.

\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Type 2 error rate}

If the alternative hypothesis is actually true, what is the chance that we make a Type 2 Error, i.e. we fail to reject the null hypothesis even when we should reject it?

~\\ \pause

\begin{itemize}

\item The answer is not obvious, but
\begin{itemize}
\item If the true population average is very close to the null hypothesis value, it will be difficult to detect a difference (and reject $H_0$).

~\\

\item If the true population average is very different from the null hypothesis value, it will be easier to detect a difference.
\end{itemize}

~\\ \pause

\item Therefore, $\beta$ must depend on the \hl{effect size} ($\delta$) in some way

\frametitle{Example - Medical history surveys}

\disc{A medical research group is recruiting people to complete short surveys about their medical history. 
For example, one survey asks for information on a person's family history in regards to cancer. Another 
survey asks about what topics were discussed during the person's last visit to a hospital. So far, on average
people complete an average of 4 surveys, with the standard deviation of 2.2 surveys. The research group 
wants to try a new interface that they think will encourage new enrollees to complete more surveys, where 
they will randomize a total of 300 enrollees to either get the new interface or the current interface (equally
distributed between the two groups). What is the power of the test that can detect an increase of 0.5 surveys 
per enrollee for the new interface compared to the old interface? Assume that the new interface does not
affect the standard deviation of completed surveys, and $\alpha = 0.05$.}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Calculating power}

The preceeding question can be rephrased as --
How likely is it that we can reject a null hypothesis of $H_0: \mu_{new} - \mu_{current} = 0$ if 
the new interface results in an increase of 0.5 surveys per enrollee, on average?

~\\

\pause
\begin{enumerate}
\item Problem 1: Which values of $(\bar{x}_{new} - \bar{x}_{current})$ represent sufficient 
evidence to reject this $H_0$?
\pause
\item Problem 2: What is the probability that we would reject this $H_0$ if $\bar{x}_{new} - \bar{x}_{current}$ 
had come from a distribution with $\mu_{new} - \mu_{current} = 0.5$, i.e. what is the probability that we 
can obtain such an observed difference from this distribution?

\subsection{Power goes up with effect size and sample size, and is inversely proportional
with significance level and standard error}
\label{mi5}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Achieving desired power}

There are several ways to increase power (and hence decrease Type 2 error rate):

\pause

\begin{enumerate}

\item Increase the sample size.

\pause

\item Decrease the standard deviation of the sample, which is equivalent to increasing the 
sample size (it will decrease the standard error). With a smaller $s$ we have a better chance 
of distinguishing the null value from the observed point estimate. This is difficult to ensure but 
cautious measurement process and limiting the population so that it is more homogenous may help.

\pause

\item Increase $\alpha$, which will make it more likely to reject $H_0$ (but note that this has the 
side effect of increasing the Type 1 error rate).

\pause

\item Consider a larger effect size. If the true mean of the population is in the alternative hypothesis 
but close to the null value, it will be harder to detect a difference.

\end{enumerate}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Recap - Calculating Power}

\begin{itemize}

\item \hl{Step 0:} Pick a meaningful effect size $\delta$ and a significance level $\alpha$

~\\

\item \hl{Step 1:} Calculate the range of values for the point estimate beyond which you would reject $H_0$ at the chosen $\alpha$ level.

~\\

\item \hl{Step 2:} Calculate the probability of observing a value from preceding step if the sample was derived from a population where $\mu = \mu_{H_0}+\delta$

\end{itemize}
