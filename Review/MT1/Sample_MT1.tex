\item \qt{Reaction distance} Reaction distances (in centimeters) for the dominant hand were recorded from a random sample of 40 randomly chosen college students. Smaller distances indicate quicker reactions. A box plot of the distribution as well as summary statistics are provided below. A professor claims that college students have \emph{quicker} reactions than the general population. The overall mean for the general population is 10 centimeters. \\

\begin{enumerate}

\item What are the appropriate hypotheses for evaluating the professor's claim?

\soln{3cm}{
\begin{align*}
H_0: \mu = 10 \\
H_A: \mu < 10
\end{align*}
}

\item Check the conditions for conducting this hypothesis test. Your statements should be \emph{in context} of the data and the research question.

{\small(\textit{Note:} You will not receive credit for simply listing the conditions, you must go through checking them in context to receive credit.)}

\soln{4cm}{
\begin{enumerate}[1.]
\item Independence: The students are sampled randomly and 40 < 10\% of all college students, therefore we can assume that the reaction distance of one student in the sample is independent of another.
\item Normality: The sample distribution is roughly symmetric (only maybe a tiny bit right skewed), indicating that the population distribution of all reaction times is also roughly symmetric. Also, sample size is greater than 30. With these, we can assume that the sampling distribution of the sample mean will be nearly normal (due to CLT).
\end{enumerate}
}

\item Evaluate the professor's claim using a hypothesis test at the $\alpha = 0.05$ significance level. Make sure to interpret your results \emph{in context} of the data and the research question.

\soln{6cm}{
\begin{align*}
SE &= \frac{4.65}{\sqrt{40}} = 735 \\
Z &= \frac{9.51 - 10}{0.735} = -0.67 \\
p-value &= 0.25 \\
\end{align*}
The p-value is greater than the significance level, we fail to reject H0. \\
The data do not provide convincing evidence that college students have quicker reactions than the population at large.
}

\item \emph{Interpret} the p-value you calculated in the previous question \emph{in context} of the data and the research question. Be concise and precise.

{\small(\textit{Note:} You are not asked to make a decision on the hypotheses -- you should have already done that in the previous question. Instead, you must interpret the meaning of the p-value as a probability.)}

\soln{3cm}{If in fact the average reaction distance of college students is 10 centimeters, \\
there is a 25\% chance of obtaining a random sample of 40 college students where the average reaction distance is 9.51 centimeters or less.
}


\item Above, you conducted a hypothesis test with $\alpha = 0.05$. Next, you want to construct a confidence interval at the \emph{equivalent confidence level}. Determine the appropriate confidence level.

 \soln{3cm}{$CL = 1 - (2 * 0.05) = 0.90$}

\item Estimate the true average dominant hand reaction distance of college students using a confidence interval at an the confidence level determined in the previous question, and interpret this interval \emph{in context} of the data and the research question.

\soln{5cm}{
\begin{align*}
z^\star_{90\%} &= 1.65 \\
9.51 \pm 1.65*0.735 &= 9.51 \pm 1.21 \\
&= (8.3, 10.72) \\
\end{align*}
We are 90\% confident that the true average dominant hand reaction distance of college students is between 8.3 cm and 10.72 cm.

\item  \qt{Epilepsy} A group of researchers want to test the possible effect of an epilepsy medication taken by pregnant mothers on the cognitive development of their children. As evidence, they want to estimate the IQ scores of three-year-old children born to mothers who were on this particular medication during pregnancy. Previous studies suggest that the standard deviation of IQ scores of three-year-old children is 18 points. How many such children should the researchers sample at a minimum in order to obtain a \emph{94\% confidence} interval with a margin of error \emph{of maximum 4 points}?

\item \qt{Calcium for treating blood pressure} Lyle et al. (1987) ran an experiment to study the effect of a calcium supplement on the blood pressure of African American males. A group of 10 men received a calcium supplement, and another group of 11 men received a placebo. The experiment lasted 12 weeks. Both before and after the 12-week period, each man had his systolic blood pressure measured while at rest. The changes in blood pressure are given in table below. \\

\begin{center}
\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.5}

\hline
Placebo: & -11 & -5	& -3	&  -3 & -1 &  -1 & -1 &  2 & 3 &  5 &  12 \\

\begin{enumerate}

\item What is the median change in the blood pressure in the \emph{calcium} group?

\item What is the median change in the blood pressure in the \emph{placebo} group?

\soln{3cm}{$Median_{placebo} = -1$}

\item We would like to test if the \emph{median} change in blood pressure is \emph{different} for the calcium and placebo groups. State the hypotheses for this test. 

{\small(\textit{Note:} You can use notation, or you can state your hypotheses in words, but make sure that it's clear what type of test you're doing -- one-sided vs. two-sided.)}

\soln{3cm}{
\begin{align*}
H_0&: Median_{calcium} = Median_{placebo} \\
H_A&: Median_{calcium} \ne Median_{placebo}
\end{align*}
}

\item Calculate the point estimate associated with these hypotheses.

\soln{3cm}{$Median_{calcium} - Median_{placebo} = 5$ \\
}

\pagebreak

\item Since theoretical methods do not apply to sampling distributions of medians, we use a randomization test. To do so, we write the change in blood pressure on 21 index cards. Then, we shuffle these cards and split them into two groups: one group of size 10 representing those receive a calcium supplement, and another group of size 11 representing those on the placebo. We calculate the difference between the medians in the simulated calcium and placebo distributions (as \emph{calcium - placebo}), and record this value. Fill in the blanks in the remainder of this description.

\begin{adjustwidth}{1.5em}{1.5em}

We repeat this 100 times to build a randomization distribution, which should be centered at \rule{3cm}{0.5pt}. Lastly, we calculate the p-value as the proportion of simulations where the simulated differences in medians is \rule{3cm}{0.5pt}.

\item Refer back to the research question: ``Is there a difference in median change in blood pressure for the calcium and placebo groups?" What does the p-value you calculated in the previous question suggest? Choose one of the following:

\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item Reject $H_0$, there is evidence of a difference between the two groups.
\item \solnMult{Fail to reject $H_0$, there isn't sufficient evidence of a difference between the two groups.}
\item Accept $H_0$, there is evidence that the median in the two groups is the same.

%\item A large university wanted to study the relationship between completing an internship during college and students' future earning potential. From the same graduating class, they selected a random sample of 80 students who completed an internship and 100 students who did not complete an internship and examined their salaries five years after graduation. They found that there was a statistically higher mean salary for the internship group than for the non-internship group. Which of the following interpretations is the \emph{most} appropriate?
%\begin{choices}
%\item More students should complete internships because having an internship produces a higher salary.
%\item \solnMult{There could be a confounding variable, such as student major, that explains the difference in mean salary between the internship and no internship groups.}
%\item You cannot draw any valid conclusions because the sample sizes are different.
%\item We cannot infer anything from these data since the distribution of salaries is likely right skewed.

%\item A class of 30 introductory statistics students took a 15 item quiz, with each item worth 1 point. The standard deviation for the resulting score distribution is 0. You know that:
%\begin{choices}

%\item Colin, a first-year student, is enrolled in a college algebra course and earned a score of 260 on a math achievement test that was given on to all first-year students prior to enrollment. The instructor looked at two distributions of scores:
%\begin{enumerate}[(1)]
%\item the distribution for all first-year students
%\item the distribution for the first-year students enrolled in this algebra course
%\end{enumerate}
%Both are approximately normally distributed and have the same mean, but the distribution for the algebra course has a smaller standard deviation. 
%
%A Z score is calculated for Colin's test score in both distributions (all first-years and the first-years taking this algebra course). Given that Colin's score is well above the mean, which of the following would be true about these two Z scores?
%\begin{choices}
%\item \solnMult{The Z score based on the distribution for the first-year students taking algebra would be higher.} 
%\item The Z score based on the distribution for all  first-year students would be higher.
%\item The two Z scores would be the same.
%\item The two Z scores would be different, but we don't have enough information to tell which Z score would be higher.
